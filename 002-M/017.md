# JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate function has an error in calculating the tRate.

## Summary
`JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function calculates the value of `tRate` larger than the right value.
Thus the borrowers of `JUSDBank` will lose more JUSD tokens when repaying or liquidating.

## Vulnerability Detail
`JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function and `getTRate` function are the following.
```solidity
    function accrueRate() public {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        if (currentTimestamp == lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
59:     tRate = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18);
        lastUpdateTimestamp = currentTimestamp;
    }

    function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
65:     uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        return tRate + (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
    }
```
As can be seen, the calculation formula for `tRate` in `L59` of `accrueRate` function differs with `L65` of `getTRate` function.
When `tRate = 1e18`, the formula of `L59` is equal to `L65`.
`JUSDBank.sol#L39` is following.
```solidity
        tRate = Types.ONE;
```
That is, since the initial value of `tRate` is `1e18` and it increases by time, `tRate > 1e18` will be always hold true.
When `tRate > 1e18`, the value of `L59` will be larger than `L65` as follows.
```solidity
    tRateInL59 = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18)
          = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR) + tRate.decmialMul(1e18)
          = tRate * (timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 1e18 + tRate * 1e18 / 1e18
          > (timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + tRate = tRateInL65
```
Since `tRate > 1e18` increases by time, the difference of two values will be larger and larger.
Since `borrowRate` is the increase amount of `tRate` in a year, the `L65` of `getTRate` is right but not for `L59` of `accrueRate` function.

## Impact
`accrueRate` function calculates the value of `tRate` larger than the right value.
`accrueRate` function is called from `borrow`, `repay` and `liquidate` function of `JUSDBank.sol`.
Thus borrowers will lose more JUSD tokens when repaying or liquidating.
As `tRate > 1e18` continues to increases, the deviation of calculation becomes larger and larger.

## Recommendation
Modify `JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function as follows.
```solidity
    function accrueRate() public {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        if (currentTimestamp == lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            return;
        }
--      uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
--      tRate = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18);
++      tRate = getTRate();
        lastUpdateTimestamp = currentTimestamp;
    }
```
